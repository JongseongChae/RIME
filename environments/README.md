# Setting up train & test environments
For train & test environments where are with fixed perturbed dynamics, please try the follow.

In the directory `home/anaconda3/envs/"your virtual name"/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/`,
unzip the provided `envs.zip` in the directory, and replace the original `envs` folder with the provided `envs` folder.

If you can't find the `gym` folder in the directory, check the package version.

* For gravity perturbation, we changed "gravity" in xml files.
* For mass perturbation, we chaned "density" or "settotalmass".
* `envs.zip` will be uploaded soon. We're sorry about that.
